# Specstory CLI Changelog

## v1.10.0 2026-02-23

### 📢 Announcements

-  Added optional [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) metrics for agent sessions. Enable via the `--telemetry-endpoint`, `--telemetry-service-name`, and `--no-telemetry-prompts` [flags](https://docs.specstory.com/integrations/terminal-coding-agents/usage#flags) on `run`, `sync`, or `watch`, or through the `telemetry` [configuration options](https://docs.specstory.com/integrations/terminal-coding-agents/usage#configuration).


## v1.9.0 2026-02-23

### ⚙️ Improvements

- SpecStory CLI now supports configuration files in TOML format at user (`~/.specstory/cli/config.toml`) and project (`./.specstory/cli/config.toml`) levels. See the [usage guide](https://docs.specstory.com/integrations/terminal-coding-agents/usage) for more details.

### 🔧 CLI Configuration & Commands

- Now the `specstory check` command checks your user and project level config files for validity.
- New `--debug-dir` flag and configuration to set the location of your debug output, separate from the `--output-dir` location.

## v1.8.0 2026-02-22

## v1.7.0 2026-02-16

### 🔧 CLI Configuration & Commands

- New `--print` flag for `specstory sync -s {session-ID} --print` command to output the markdown to stdout rather than sync it to a file. The flag works for multiple sessions with `specstory sync -s {id1} -s {id2} --print`.
- For the `specstory run claude` command, prefer the Claude Code "native install", `~/.local/bin/claude`, over the npm install, `~/.claude/local/claude`, when both are present.

- The Claude Code provider now gracefully handles corrupt JSON objects in JSONL session data, continuing to parse valid entries rather than failing to render the session.

### 🔧 CLI Configuration & Commands

- `specstory sync` now displays progress feedback while parsing sessions.
- The `-s` flag on `specstory sync` now accepts multiple session IDs: `specstory sync -s {id1} -s {id2}`.
